* overview

warning - this is an anti-social script.  i'm not recommending its use, but i
can see the utility.  if you must have the mayorship of your local
bar/coffeeshop, etc. you might find it useful.  this exercises a very little
bit of the foursquare API and allows you to interact with the API.

* requirements

 - libwww-perl - this has the HTTP client functionality, commonly available.
 - JSON - used to parse the responses from foursquare

* configuration

you'll want to make sure that you create the appropriate .4squatterrc file
with the right username and password, etc. put into place.  

* seeding the process

in order to seed the process you should dig up the latitude and longitude of
the area where you'd like to poke around.  then get the list of the venues
that are nearby.
